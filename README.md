# Getting Shwifty
I figured out using an organization would allow us to access the discussions feature which i think will be nice, plus i think this will solve some headaches in regard to workflow/organization/hosting because we were also going to need seperate reps for our landing page/blog/merch and this will alow us to keep seperate repos for everything in the same spot.
